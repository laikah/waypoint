curator: Charlotte van Oostrum 

summary: You learn best from your mistakes and in collaboration with others. Embrace a new style of learning by learning to dwell.

description: |
  Learning is a process of constant negotiation with content 
  and with people. It’s about being wrong AND right. 
  About learning AND teaching. You learn best from your mistakes 
  and in collaboration with others. So welcome failure, 
  share your work when you’re in the middle, and engage. 
  Don’t follow a straight trajectory, but explore. 
  Embrace a new style of learning by learning to dwell.

  - title: Love Being Wrong
    introduction: |
      What does being wrong feels like? If anything, 
      like being right. It’s realizing you’re wrong 
      that feels horrible. But being wrong is human. 
      We’re wrong 50% of the time, we just don’t know which 50%. 
      Start loving to be wrong.
