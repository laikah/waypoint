  Sharing is the cornerstone of our platform. To enrich knowlegde 
  you need to have input and content easily accessible by everybody. 
  Input does not necessarily mean to write and compile a waypoint yourself.
  You also contribute by rating and reviewing the material 
  you have just consumed by doing so, you actually enable 
  your learning process and become an active member of a vital community.

  - title: Open source it
    introduction: |
      We believe in having our content accessible to everybody and thus making sure 
      the threshold to using learning material can be reached even with limitted resources.
      The same applies to the code we use. Unlocking code and content means the community
      can build and further develop the material, and so enrich knowlegde and maximize value.
